# Tasks-App
A web app that allows users to manage tasks
##### Start using the app at localhost:3000/welcome     

### Techniques Used
This app was created to hone my skills at: 

 * JavaScript _Promises_
 * JavaScript
 * Express
 * Node
 * jQuery
 
### Techniques Learned
During this project I also learned to use:

 * Materialize
 * Jade
 * git

I found Jade to be easy to read and write but it was time consumming to use a HTML->Jade translator when also wanting to use
Materialize's components. Materialize is beautiful frontend framework and I'm glad I used it but bootstrape has more options. 

### How to Run
 1. Clone the repository
 2. `npm install`
 3. `npm install -g nodemon`
 4. `nodemon`
 5. `open http://locolhost:3000`

### To Do
I don't think any project is every *really* finished. So here is what I still want to improve:
 
  * Add MySQL or MongoDB
  * Add sessions/cookies
  * let users edit their profile picture
  * improve the email requirment


##### Note
This is my first github repository (yeah!) and will not be my last! I have many other projects in the works, just not cleaned up enough
to show off.

Thanks for visiting!
